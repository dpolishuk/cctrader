TASK 10 TEST VERIFICATION COMPLETE
====================================

Baseline (Pre-Refactor):
- 36 passing
- 1 failed  
- 7 errors (pre-existing in test_paper_trading.py)

Current Results (Post-Refactor):
- 41 passing (+5)
- 0 failed (-1)
- 7 errors (unchanged, pre-existing)

Bundled Tools Tests:
- 4/4 PASSED ✓

Issues Found and Fixed:
1. test_scanner_bundled_tools.py had incorrect patch paths:
   - Changed 'agent.scanner.tools.*' → 'src.agent.scanner.tools.*'
   - Fixed in 4 test functions

2. test_prompts.py checking for obsolete 'perplexity' reference:
   - Changed assertion from 'perplexity' → 'web search'
   - This reflects the OpenWebSearch MCP migration

Result: NO NEW FAILURES
- All 41 tests that should pass are passing
- 7 pre-existing errors remain (async fixture deprecation warnings)
- Refactoring did NOT break any functionality
- Test suite is actually BETTER (5 more tests passing)
